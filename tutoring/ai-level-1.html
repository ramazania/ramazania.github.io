# FAI3 Introduction to Search Problems

<h2>FAI3 Project 1: Airports Problem</h2>
Let’s try simulating the Airports Problem we discussed earlier. We are given that the following cities exist:
<ul>
<li>New York</li>
<li>San Francisco</li>
<li>Washington D.C</li>
<li>Seattle</li>
<li>Los Angeles</li>
<li>Boston</li>
</ul>

We are given that the following flights exist with the specified flight lengths:
<ul>
<li>Boston to Washington D.C (2 hours)</li>
<li>Boston to New York (1 hour)</li>
<li>New York to San Francisco (6 hours)</li>
<li>Washington D.C to Seattle (7 hours)</li>
<li>Seattle to San Francisco (3 hours)</li>
<li>San Francisco to Los Angeles (1 hour)</li>
</ul>

We want to find the fastest way to get from Boston to Los Angeles. Write a <code>Node</code> class and a <code>StateSpaceGraph</code> class that can be used to simulate this search problem. Then, construct the state space graph for this problem using your classes and write a method called <code>manual_search()</code> in your <code>StateSpaceGraph</code> class that takes in the start and end states of the search problem. In the function, print all the possible locations that a user can travel to from the start node and have them enter what node they want to go to next. Travel to that node and continue prompting the user and traveling until you reach the destination node. Make sure to track the amount of time required to get from the start node to the end node.

# FAI4 Stacks and Queues

<h2>FAI4 Project 1: Practice with Stacks</h2>
Complete each of the following exercises using stacks.
<br/>
<br/>
Create an empty stack. Push the number 1 to 10 on the stack. Pop elements from the stack and print each popped element until the stack is empty.
<br/>
<br/>
<code>isPalindrome()</code>: write a function that takes in a <code>String</code> and returns whether or not that <code>String</code> is a Palindrome. The function should check if the string is a palindrome using a stack.
<br/>
<br/>
<code>evaluateExpression()</code>: Reverse Polish Notation is another way to write an algebraic expression. Here are some examples of normal arithmetic expressions converted into Reverse Polish Notation:
<ul>
<li>“2 + 3” = “2 3 +”</li>
<li>“1 - 3” = “1 3 -”</li>
<li>“4 * (3 + 5)” = “3 5 + 4 *”</li>
<li>“4 * (3 + (6 / 2))” = “6 2 / 3 + 4 *”</li>
</ul>
Write a function that takes in an expression in Reverse Polish Notation and returns the simplified value of that expression using a stack (assume the entire expression is valid with spaces between each term/operation).

<h2>FAI4 Project 2: Practice with Queues</h2>
Complete each of the following exercises using queues.
<br/>
<br/>
Create an empty queue. Enqueue the numbers 1 to 10 to the queue. Dequeue elements from the queue and print the dequeued element until the queue is empty.
<br/><br/>
<code>getEvens()</code>: Write a function that takes in a queue and returns another queue of the even numbers in the inputted queue in the same order. For example, if your function takes in the queue <code>{1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 6}</code> where 1 is at the front of the queue, the function should return <code>{2, 6, 4, 6}</code>.
<br/>
<br/>
<code>buildQueueString()</code>: A <code>QueueString</code> is a special type of expression where each letter represents an enqueue operation in a queue and every asterisk represents a dequeue operation in a queue. To build a <code>QueueString</code>, you need to build a regular string out of every dequeue operation in the <code>QueueString</code>. Here are some examples of built <code>QueueStrings</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>“H*ELL**O**” = “HELLO”</code></li>
<li><code>“Q*UE*UES** A**R*E CO***O**L***” =&gt; “QUEUES ARE COOL”</code></li>
</ul>
Write a function that takes in a <code>QueueString</code> (represented as an ordinary string) and return the built version of the <code>QueueString</code>. What input needs to go into the function if you want to build the string <code>“CODING IS FUN”</code>?

<h2>FAI5 Project 2: Juni-Book</h2>
Let’s apply DFS to a problem. You decided that you want to build your own social networking app called Juni-Book. You want to know how many groups of friends are on your app. Person A is in the same group as Person B if it is possible for Person A to reach Person B through a series of hops through their mutual friends. For example, if Person A is friends with Person C, Person C is friends with Person D and Person D is friends with Person B, then Person A and Person B are in the same group (as are Persons C and D). Write a program that can determine how many distinct groups of friends are currently on your app. Using your undirected, unweighted <code>Node</code> and <code>Graph</code> classes (rename your <code>Graph</code> class as <code>FriendGraph</code>), add an instance method to the <code>FriendGraph</code> class called <code>count_groups()</code>. This method should use DFS to determine the number of distinct friend groups currently using Juni-Book.

<h2>FAI8 Project 2: The Marble Game AI</h2>
In the Marble Game, there are two players and a pile of n marbles. Each player takes turns picking up 1, 2 or 3 marbles. A player wins if they pick up the last marble. Write a program that simulates the Marble Game against an AI using the minimax algorithm. You will need to modify the <code>TreeNode</code> and <code>Tree</code> classes from your last project (Note: This AI is not unbeatable like the Tic Tac Toe AI due to the nature of the game).

<h2>FAI9 Project 4: Maze Solver</h2>
<b>Starter link: </b><a href="https://replit.com/@JuniLearning/FAI9-Maze-Solver-Starter" target="blank">https://replit.com/@JuniLearning/FAI9-Maze-Solver-Starter</a>
<br/>
Simulate solving a maze using each of the traversal algorithms you’ve learned so far. In the <code>Graph</code> class of your starter code, implement the instance methods <code>get_bfs_path()</code>, <code>get_dfs_path()</code>, <code>get_ids_path()</code> and <code>get_ucs_path()</code>. Each of these methods should take in the initial state and the goal state <code>Nodes</code> and return a path from the initial state to the goal state using the specified searching algorithm. The returned path should be a list of the keys of the <code>Nodes</code> on the path. Call <code>maze.print_path()</code> and <code>g.get_path_cost()</code> on the returned paths to simulate solving the maze and get the cost of the path.

<h2>FAI10 Project 3: Water Jug Riddle</h2>
You have two jugs. One holds 3 liters of water and the other holds 5 liters of water. You can fill any of these jugs up to the top using a water fountain, empty them out or pour from one jug to the other. Note that when you pour from one jug to the other, you can only fill to the top of the other jug without letting the water spill out. Write a program that uses greedy search and A* search to determine the sequence of actions needed to for you to end up with one of the jugs containing 4L of water. You should write a <code>Node</code> class to store each state as well as a <code>Graph</code> class to write your search algorithms in. Be sure to print the number of states each search method visited.
